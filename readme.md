# Child Theme Gulp Scaffold
This theme is created and maintained by Matthew Hall, Matthewhall.info, as a starter for developing on client sites. 

The purpose of this is simply to generate a gulp process for developing templates with gulp running my build/linting on SCSS/JS/PHP. 



## Core Functionality / Explainer
This to build the gulp file into the build file with a zip in the dist that provides a clean install copy.

There is an additonal behavior to sync the build file into a local (formerly local by WP) site. 

### Must set up on every ENV: 
- .env file from sample_dot_env

some .env variables may be moved to git depending on the open/closedness of your project git rep. 

## This is a Child Theme
- Current basis is as a child of Astra theme
